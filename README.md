# Mining Hardware Design Files

This repo contains various hardware design files that I’ve chosen to publish.  
Some projects are open, some are closed — I don’t have a philosophy about it.  
I release things when I feel like it.

## ✅ What you’ll find here

Depending on the project, expect things like:

| File / Folder | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| `*.kicad_pcb / *.sch` | KiCad board + schematic files |
| `BOM.*` | Bill of Materials |
| `*.cpl` | Pick-and-place / centroid files |
| `gerbers/` | Manufacturing outputs |
| `mechanical/` | STEP/STL / mechanical drawings (if included) |
| `firmware/` | If relevant (not guaranteed) |

In many cases, these files are enough to manufacture a board end-to-end.

Use your judgment.

## ⚠️ Use At Your Own Risk

I’m providing these files **as-is**:

- No warranty  
- No guarantee that anything is correct  
- No support or hand-holding  

If you build something and it doesn’t work, or you destroy hardware, that’s on you.
